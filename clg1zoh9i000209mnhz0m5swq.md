1. what is DevOps?
    
    #DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.
    
    **DevOps** **Dev** =development and **Ops**\=operations is the combination of practices and tools designed to increase an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services faster than traditional software development processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.
    
2. What are #Automation, scaling, and Infrastructure?
    
    **<mark>#DevOps</mark>** **<mark>automation</mark>** is the addition of technology that performs tasks with reduced human assistance to processes that facilitate feedback loops between operations and development teams so that iterative updates can be deployed faster to applications in production.
    
    There are various automation **<mark>tools</mark>** for DevOps, few of them are:
    
    #<mark>Jenkins #Git and GitHub #Docker #Kubernetes #Ansible #Terraform</mark>
    
    **<mark>Scaling</mark>** is another important aspect of DevOps. As applications grow and more users interact with them, the infrastructure supporting their needs to be able to scale up to handle the increased load. This can be achieved through the use of cloud computing resources, such as auto-scaling groups, load balancers, and distributed databases. DevOps teams need to design their applications and infrastructure to be scalable from the outset.
    
    **<mark>#Infrastructure</mark>** refers to the underlying technology that supports an application or service. In the context of DevOps, infrastructure can include servers, databases, networks, and other components. DevOps teams need to be able to manage their infrastructure in an automated and scalable way to support the demands of their applications. Infrastructure as code (IaC) is a common practice in DevOps, where infrastructure is defined and managed using code, which enables teams to automate the management of their infrastructure.
    
3. why devOps is important?
    
    Maximizes Efficiency with #Automation.
    
    Reduced Deployment Rollbacks, failures, and Time to Recover.
    
    Increased reliability and improved collaboration.
    
    Enhanced Scalability.
    
    Cost Saving.
